The process required to create a two-tone ceramic bezel was initially thought to be too tricky to produce commercially. Thankfully, that changed in recent years, as is evident with the Rolex 126710 for sale here. This edition is also the first example of the Pepsi model in both stainless steel and ceramic.",

The earliest Sea-Dweller examples had red printing and are called \"Single Red\" because of the one line of red text about the 6 o'clock marker, while the \"Double Red\" (featured here) features the words \"Sea-Dweller\" and \"Submariner 2000\" in red text above the 6 o'clock marker. Rolex made the double red version until around 1978 and at that point they switched to all white text.

		"description": "Pre-owned Rolex Submariner ref 126613 (2021) is one of the hottest watches on the market. The series set tongues wagging when it debuted with the anticipated integration of Rolex's newest calibre 3235 and a larger 41mm case size. Just 1mm larger than the Sub that we have come to know and love over the past several decades, the most recent offerings are just large enough to make a statement and satiate a growing trend for larger timepieces without appearing too large or over-the-top. The 126613 Rolex is just one of many references within the 41 series. It's a Yellow Rolesor edition that pairs Oystersteel with 18k yellow gold, creating a highly resilient and very handsome two-tone finish. The black Cerachrom dial and black Maxi dial topped with Chromalight plots add the finishing touches to this irresistible diver. There is no need to join a long waitlist to add one to your collection. This example is in stock NOW!",

Looking at the dial, it sports the charming \"Smiley Face\" text and iconic Snowflake-style hands, as well as a larger crown without the usual guards we see on modern dive watches. What's also interesting about ref 79500 is that it was considerably smaller than the rest of the heritage lineup when it came to market in 2016, which likely accounts for the collection's immense popularity at the time.

Because the watch was such an innovation of its time, it has remained one of the Big Crown's most successful and enduring models. One of the most iconic iterations of the series is the steel and gold Rolex for sale here. Ref. 16013 features a charming older-style case outfitted with a fluted bezel, an acrylic crystal, and a champagne dial decorated with Tritium. The 5-link Jubilee bracelet drapes nicely around the wrist, making this Rolex even more recognizable among collectors in the know.",

		"description": "The Rolex 16710 is a cult favorite among loyal Rolex fans because it boasts a pre-super case design set, complete with an older-style bracelet and an older-style case with more tapered lugs and a smaller crown guard. Despite keeping the same 40mm diameter as its contemporary successors, ref. 16710 wears slightly smaller on the wrist. This feature set is very desirable among purists of the brand. Furthermore, ref. 16710 holds a special place in GMT Master II history because it was the first example to feature a slimmer case and movement. It was produced for decades, featuring either a two-tone or all-black bezel and Tritium, Luminova, or Superluminova hour markers and hands. It's a fun used Rolex watch to hunt for and collect.

This edition of the GMT Master II hit the market in the late 1980s, bringing with it a refined case with a slimmer profile and a slimmer movement. The result was an edition of the famed pilot's watch that boasted both the then-new independent GMT hand and a comfortable size and weight. While many examples today feature a two-tone bezel, this used Rolex is equipped with a coveted all-black bezel in aluminum. It is a prized collector's item among many Rolex enthusiasts, and it can be yours today for a very competitive pre-owned Rolex price.",

Features include the next-generation caliber 3861 mechanical hand-wound movement, a 50-hour power reserve, a Hesalite crystal, and a black dial and bezel. This pre-owned Omega takes much inspiration from the Speedys that once ventured to the Moon with a similar asymmetrical case, black step dial, and dot over 90 (DON) bezel.

This watch was born with a black dial and over the years it has turned to a beautiful brown and caramel color throughout. The left side of the dial is a bit darker than the right side and the whole dial has aged in a atheistically pleasing way.

Rolex initially used glossy dials in the 1675 until around 1966 and switched to matte dials.  This circa 1969 example is in overall beautiful condition with it's beautifully aged lume and gorgeous bezel. Collectors refer to this dial variation as a Mark I \"Long E.\" When looking at  the \"Rolex\" text on the dial the \"E\" has a longer central bar (same length as the top and bottom ones) and that is where this nickname comes from. Rolex made many iterations of the GMT over the years and this watch has a couple additional interesting things to note. This watch also has the correct date-wheel for the time period with the closed 6's and 9s as well as hooked 7s.  This watch is just stunning in the metal.

Throughout the production of the 5512 Rolex made many different variations, from glossy dials to matte dials with many slight updates and changes. The 5512 may look nearly identical to the 5513 (that came out in 1962, three years later) but the main difference would be that the 5512 has the chronometer certified movement (COSC). Since the 5512 had a COSC movement, they were more expensive than the 5513 and were not as popular, we see less of them in general. The 5512s would typically have four lines of text at the bottom of the dial and the 5513 always has two; that is one good way of telling apart the references at a glance Its not always that simple, early examples of the 5512 also have two lines of text, but still have the COSC movement.  Overall the 5512 is a cult favorite and we see many collectors gravitate towards these especially after they have gone down the rabbit hole.",

Throughout the production of the 5512 Rolex made many different variations, from glossy dials to matte dials with many slight updates and changes. The 5512 may look nearly identical to the 5513 (that came out in 1962, three years later) but the main difference would be that the 5512 has the chronometer certified movement (COSC). Since the 5512 had a COSC movement, they were more expensive than the 5513 and were not as popular, we see less of them in general. The 5512s would typically have four lines of text at the bottom of the dial and the 5513 always has two; that is one good way of telling apart the references at a glance Its not always that simple, early examples of the 5512 also have two lines of text, but still have the COSC movement.  Overall the 5512 is a cult favorite and we see many collectors gravitate towards these especially after they have gone down the rabbit hole.",

		"description": "The 1655 Explorer is instantly recognizable from its bright orange 24 hour hand to its steel 24 hour bezel. Rolex came out with this model in 1971 and it was specifically made for cave explorers. The purpose of the orange 24 hour hand is to help the wearer distinguish day vs night in environments where this isn't easily noticeable, like in a cave with complete darkness. Rolex made the ref. 1655 until approximately 1985 and Rolex made a few different variations during the production. Collectors have identified five different dials that were originally offered in the ref. 1655. The watch we have here has a lovely Mark 5 dial and would be the last dial variation before Rolex discontinued the 1655 and came out with the successor, 16550.",

In addition to sporting Rolex's famous Triplock screw-down crown with three hermetically-sealed zones, it is also furnished with a Helium Escape Valve, Ring Lock System, a thicker 5mm sapphire crystal, and a flexible titanium case back. As a result, this watch is quite robust, measuring 44mm in diameter. At the same time, it maintains Rolex's signature sophisticated elegance with a lustrous black ceramic bezel and matching black dial with white gold-trimmed hour markers and hands. Most collectors will never need to take their Rolex thousands of feet into the ocean. Still, the sheer ingenuity and watchmaking prowess required to accomplish such a feat is enough to win over even the most discerning collectors.",

The movement is equipped with anti-shock technology and is protected against moisture for an accurate reading on or off the race track. The Daytona earns its nostalgic nickname from the track itself, of which Rolex has been the official timekeeper for decades. The ref. 116520 was the first reference to run on a movement developed entirely in-house and is a very desirable edition of the Daytona collection.

When ref. 114300 was discontinued, Rolex stopped producing a 39mm option within the OP collection.

		"description": "The Oris Aquis Depth Gauge is often lovingly referred to as the \"watch with a hole\" because of the tiny hole located on the sapphire crystal. The gauge measures the wearer's depth using the Boyle-Mariotte Law. As the wearer dives below the ocean's surface, water enters the hole and through a channel milled into the crystal, thus displaying the current depth alongside the gauge presented in yellow surrounding the dial. This innovative concept has since won over luxury watch enthusiasts of all lifestyles and professions, and it can be yours today in UNWORN pre-owned Oris condition.",

		"description": "Oris released their innovative Depth Gauge in 2013. This watch accurately and reliably measures depth using physics, a tiny hole placed in the scratch-resistant sapphire crystal, and a milled channel. As the wearer ventures further below the ocean's surface, more water will enter the milled channel, indicating the wearer's current depth. While diving, the air within the channel becomes compressed, allowing more water into the channel. Conversely, as the wearer ascends back to the surface, the air decompresses, forcing the water out. This clever design doesn't rely on mechanics like other brands, making the Oris Depth Gauge even more reliable. The brand recently released a new model for 2021.

The case is waterproof up to 100 meters and features a uni-directional time-lapse bezel. Our example comes to us today in pre-owned/unworn condition.
