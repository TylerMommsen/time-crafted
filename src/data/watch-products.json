    "description": "Pre-owned Rolex Yacht-Master II ref 116680 (2020) came to market in 2013, debuting a new movement for the collection - the caliber 4161. The watch has seen a few upgrades since then, including the indices and hands, which we can see here on this newer production Rolex. The stick hands have been replaced with a traditional Mercedes-style hour hand and a skeleton minute hand for optimal visibility. Furthermore, the blued indices on early iterations of the watch have been replaced with glitzier white gold. As with all things Rolex, this attention to detail can make all the difference when searching for the perfect model for your wrist. Aesthetics aside, ref. 116680 is a truly impressive Rolex masterpiece. The movement boasts a programmable countdown and convenient fly-back function and works with the Ring Command Bezel.

    "description": "Rolex introduced the 1016 Explorer in 1959 and it was in production until 1989 making it one of the longest running produced references from the brand. At the beginning of the run Rolex made the dials glossy and then switched to the matte style around 1966. The example we have here is circa 1966 and features a glossy dial, this would have been the last variation of the glossy dial before Rolex went to the matte version. This watch was born with a black dial and over the years it has turned to a beautiful brown and caramel color throughout. The left side of the dial is a bit darker than the right side and the whole dial has aged in a atheistically pleasing way. Collectors tend to gravitate towards tropical dials like this because no two will age the exact same making them unique. ",

    "description": "2021 was an exciting year for the Black Bay 58. Tudor released the popular retro-inspired dive watch in two precious metal finishes, yellow gold and, somewhat surprisingly, 925 silver. It's an unusual material as far as dive watches are concerned, and that's precisely why so many die-hard collectors strive to add one to their watch boxes. We have a very nice example in stock right now in excellent secondhand condition. Tudor pairs the striking silver case with a taupe dial and matte aluminum bezel to match the cool tones of the silver finish - a brilliant pairing. Other features include Tudor's iconic snowflake hands and applied hour markers, a domed sapphire crystal, a uni-directional time-lapse diver's bezel, water resistance up to 200 meters, and the in-house caliber MT5400 self-winding movement with a 70-hour power reserve.",

    "description": " Pre-owned Rolex Submariner ref 5512 (1979) is an important reference in Submariner history; It was the first Submariner to feature crown guards, a detail that all Subs would have going forward and still do today. Throughout the production of the 5512 Rolex made many different variations, from glossy dials to matte dials with many slight updates and changes. The 5512 may look nearly identical to the 5513 (that came out in 1962, three years later) but the main difference would be that the 5512 has the chronometer certified movement (COSC). Since the 5512 had a COSC movement, they were more expensive than the 5513 and were not as popular, we see less of them in general. The 5512s would typically have four lines of text at the bottom of the dial and the 5513 always has two; that is one good way of telling apart the references at a glance Its not always that simple, early examples of the 5512 also have two lines of text, but still have the COSC movement.  Overall the 5512 is a cult favorite and we see many collectors gravitate towards these especially after they have gone down the rabbit hole. ",

It came to market in 1955, with ref. 6542 and the ref. 1675 following shortly after in 1959. It’s one of the most sought-after vintage Rolex watches on the secondary market because it’s instantly recognizable with its 24-hour bezel and dedicated GMT hand. The Rolex 1675 was also notably the first GMT Master to use crown guards. Rolex initially used glossy dials in the 1675 until around 1966 and switched to matte dials. Over the years Rolex made many different variations of the 1675 and this example features a matte \"Mark II\" dial. The best way to distinguish the mark 2 dial from other matte dials is the font, thickness, and spacing of the word \"Rolex\" on the dial. ",

    "description": "The GMT Master is Rolex’s signature pilot’s watch, complete with dual-time capabilities. It came to market in 1955, with ref. 1675 following shortly after in 1959. It’s one of the most sought-after vintage Rolex watches on the secondary market because it’s instantly recognizable with its 24-hour bezel and dedicated GMT hand. The Rolex 1675 was also notably the first GMT Master to use crown guards. Rolex initially used glossy dials in the 1675 until around 1966 and switched to matte dials. Rolex made a few different matte dial variations. Collectors refer to this dial variation as a Mark I \"Long E.\" When looking at  the \"Rolex\" text on the dial the \"E\" has a longer central bar (same length as the top and bottom ones) and that is where the nickname comes from. ",

When it came to market just a few years ago, it was the first model to feature both a stainless steel finish and a Pepsi bezel in ceramic - aka \"Cerachrom.\" This watch is hot and is hard to purchase at the retail level. We have a very handsome example for sale here today in excellent secondhand condition.",

These features are maintained in the reference 168000 with the only difference being the addition of a stronger, more resilient 904L stainless steel used throughout the 40mm Oyster case, Oyster bracelet, and Oysterlock clasp.  The reference 168000 is an important piece of the Submariner history and is the direct predecessor to the ref. 16610 and looks nearly identical. The 168000 is the perfect watch for someone looking for a vintage watch that has all the creature comforts of a modern watch and that is still very wearable for everyday use.

    "description": "Pre-owned Rolex Submariner ref 5512 (1970) is an important reference in Submariner history; It was the first Submariner to feature crown guards, a detail that all Subs would have going forward and still do today. Throughout the production of the 5512 Rolex made many different variations, from glossy dials to matte dials with many slight updates and changes. The 5512 may look nearly identical to the 5513 (that came out in 1962, three years later) but the main difference would be that the 5512 has the chronometer certified movement (COSC). Since the 5512 had a COSC movement, they were more expensive than the 5513 and were not as popular, we see less of them in general. The 5512s would typically have four lines of text at the bottom of the dial and the 5513 always has two; that is one good way of telling apart the references at a glance Its not always that simple, early examples of the 5512 also have two lines of text, but still have the COSC movement.  Overall the 5512 is a cult favorite and we see many collectors gravitate towards these especially after they have gone down the rabbit hole. ",

The 1680 also holds a special place in Rolex history as the first Submariner to feature a date mechanism on the dial. Rolex initially made the 1680 with a single line of red text on the dial and would later move to all white text like the example we have here. These \"White\" 1680s have gained popularity and good ones are becoming harder and harder to find. ",

Rolex made the double red version until around 1978 and at that point they switched to all white text.

    "description": "Pre-owned Rolex Submariner ref 126613 (2020). Since it hit the market in the 1980s, the pre-owned steel and gold model has been a prized collector's item. When the Sub debuted in 1953, it was only available in stainless steel. A short while later, the all-gold edition hit the market. It wasn't until the 80s that collectors were able to invest a two-tone, which many seek for its use of gold without the top-tier price of an all-gold watch. Rolex 126613 is a modern take on the two-tone diver, complete with a newer-style bezel outfitted with a vibrant blue ceramic insert, a matching blue Maxi dial with larger markers, and a new-style 41mm case and bracelet. ",

At Basel World 2013, Rolex surprised the watch community by introducing the Batman model, the first timepiece in the brand's catalog to boast a two-tone ceramic bezel insert.

It also notably introduced the iconic pilot's watch to a tougher scratch-resistant sapphire crystal and a newer case design. The example you see here was produced at the beginning of ref. 16700's production and features Tritium hour markers and hands, a desirable blue Pepsi bezel, and a three-link Oyster bracelet.

Tudor has been scaling things down within the collection and the new-model Tudor ref. 79000 is the sleekest and slimmest model yet. The original model debuted at 41mm in diameter, followed by a 39mm edition. Now, we have a 37mm watch via ref. 79000. The case measures 37mm in diameter by 46mm from lug-to-lug and 11.24mm in height. Other features include the in-house Tudor caliber MT5400 with automatic winding and a 70-hour power reserve, a black \"gilt\" dial similar to the 1954 model, and an aluminum bezel with minimal markings.  A modern Tudor with the charm of a vintage dive watch.",
